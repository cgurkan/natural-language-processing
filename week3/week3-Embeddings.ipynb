Don't delete results of this task because you will need it in the final project.\n","\n","### How it works and what's the main difference with word2vec?\n","The main point in this section is that StarSpace can be trained specifically for some tasks. In contrast to word2vec model, which tries to train similar embeddings for words in similar contexts, StarSpace uses embeddings for the whole sentence (just as a sum of embeddings of words and phrases). Despite the fact that in both cases we get word embeddings as a result of the training, StarSpace embeddings are trained using some supervised data, e.g. a set of similar sentence pairs, and thus they can better suit the task.\n","\n","In our case, StarSpace should use two types of sentence pairs for training: \"positive\" and \"negative\". \"Positive\" examples are extracted from the train sample (duplicates, high similarity) and the \"negative\" examples are generated randomly (low similarity assumed). \n","\n","### How to choose the best params for the model?\n","Normally, you would start with some default choice and then run extensive experiments to compare different strategies. However, we have some recommendations ready for you to save your time:\n","- Be careful with choosing the suitable training mode. In this task we want to explore texts similarity which corresponds to *trainMode = 3*.\n","- Use adagrad optimization (parameter *adagrad = true*).\n","- Set the length of phrase equal to 1 (parameter *ngrams*), because we need embeddings only for words.\n","- Don't use a large number of *epochs* (we think that 5 should be enough).\n","- Try dimension *dim* equal to 100.\n","- To compare embeddings usually *cosine* *similarity* is used.\n","- Set *minCount* greater than 1 (for example, 2) if you don't want to get embeddings for extremely rare words.\n","- Parameter *verbose = true* could show you the progress of the training process.\n","- Set parameter *fileFormat* equals *labelDoc*.\n","- Parameter *negSearchLimit* is responsible for a number of negative examples which is used during the training. We think that 10 will be enought for this task.\n","- To increase a speed of training we recommend to set *learning rate* to 0.05."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Js2lQwIojWxj","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Train StarSpace embeddings for unigrams on the train dataset.
